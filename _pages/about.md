I'm a 5th year PhD student at the University of Michigan's School of Information. My research is broadly on computational social science and social computing aimed at building better online communities. Currently, I focus on making conversations in online communities more deliberative and insightful. Drawing from social psychology and political science theories, I design studies, both observational and experimental, to inform building online spaces that can facilitate quality cross-cutting political interactions. I'm advised by [Ceren Budak](http://cbudak.com/index.html) and [Paul Resnick](http://presnick.people.si.umich.edu/).

Before starting my PhD, I worked at [Doximity](https://www.doximity.com/), a social network for medical professionals, as a data scientist for a few years. I have a Masters degree in Computer Science from Arizona State University where I worked with [Huan Liu](http://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/) on detecting sarcasm. Before that, I completed my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from VIT University, India during which time I worked with [Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/pk) at IIIT Delhi on detecting phishing attacks.

I was awarded a Facebook fellowship in Computational Social Science in 2020. Here's the [research summary](http://ashwin-r.github.io/files/latest_fb_fellowship.pdf) I submitted as part of my application, hopefully it's useful for others applying.
