I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Communication Studies](https://commstudies.utexas.edu/), Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas, Austin. I study how people engage with politics online. I am interested in how online spaces can foster spirited, engaging political discussions and contribute to building a vibrant deliberative democracy. I combine large-scale computational methods with qualitative interviews to (re)design online spaces to facilitate quality online political interactions. 



I received my PhD in Information from the [University of Michigan](https://www.si.umich.edu/). Before starting my PhD, I worked at [Doximity](https://www.doximity.com/), a social network for medical professionals, as a data scientist for a few years. I have a Masters degree in Computer Science from [Arizona State University](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/). Before that, I completed my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from [VIT University, India](https://vit.ac.in/).
